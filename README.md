# MSC_project
Code from my MSc project. Explaining a deep learning architecture achieving text summarisation.

The code is still to be adapted for more general use. I still need to work on it when I have some time to.

Here is the link to my MSc report, explaining all the work that has been done : http://www.explain-ai.com/Files/report.pdf
